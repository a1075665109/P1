For this project I have choosen option 3
I have built a 2d array based on the fsatable in scanner.cpp called fsaArray
My diver is the scanner function under scanner.cpp 
The make command will make an executable called scanner as shown on canvas
I categorized the "." symbol as a delimiter token for I wasn't sure which token it falls into
Token arrays,token name arrays, and token struct is implemented based on P1 Suggestion on canvas
